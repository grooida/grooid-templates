What is ${projectName}
--------------------------------------

You've just created a basic Google Glass Android-Groovy application. It provides a standard project structure and
a basic Gradle plugin. Now is up to you to add your source files and edit them with Android Studio
and have fun :)
This uses the experimental audio app launching recognition. Your app will appear in the 'OK glass' menu, so you can say 'OK GLASS appName' to run it, or go through the scroll bar stuff.
